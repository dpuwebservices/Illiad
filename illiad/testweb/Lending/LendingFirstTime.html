									<h1>First Time User Registration for Interlibrary Loan</h1>			
									
									<p>
									To request an item through Interlibrary Loan, you must first identify yourself to the library's ILLiad system. To do this you fill out a registration form using your Web browser.<br />
									Registration has three purposes:
									</p>
									
									<ul>
										<li>Entering your institution's information into the ILLiad system means you will not have to supply the information again when making future requests.</li>
										<li>Having your e-mail and mailing address on file with Interlibrary Loan enables us to notify you promptly and deliver materials accurately when 
											your request arrives in the library.</li>
										<li>You will have secure access to information about your requests. You will also be able to review
											the list of items you have requested in the past.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h2>About your Username and Password</h2>
									<p>
									During registration, you will be asked to enter your OCLC Symbol and a Password. You will use this when logging on to the ILLiad system in the future.</p>
									
									<b>Symbol</b><br />
									This is your OCLC 3 or 5 letter alpha/numeric code assigned by OCLC.<br />
									
									<b>Password</b><br />
									Choose anything you like. We recommend that you follow good security practice and choose a password that is different from those you use to access other systems.<br />
									ILLiad will encrypt your password, so it will remain secure. Only you will know your password.

									<h2>Important Copyright Information</h2>
									<p>WARNING CONCERNING COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS</p>
									<p>The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted materials.</p>
									<p>Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the
									   photocopy or reproduction is not to be &quot;used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research&quot;. If a user makes a request for, or later uses,
									   a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of &quot;fair use&quot;, that user may be liable for copyright infringement.</p>
									<p>This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.</p>
									
									<hr />
									
									<h2>ILLiad-Accessing Materials</h2>
									<h3>Loans</h3>	
									<p>The general collection is eligible for interlibrary loan for a period of eight weeks with no renewals.  Items will be available within 1-2 business days after receiving the request.  Items will be shipped via USPS to the borrowing institution unless otherwise specified. If the borrower wishes to pick up the item, an email notification will be sent when the item is ready and may be picked up only from our Lincoln Park location (2350 N. Kenmore Ave, Chicago, IL 60614).</p>
